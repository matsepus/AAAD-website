    <div>I am tired of CSS and web-design, so this is pretty bare-bones for now.</div>
    
    <h1>About This Project (According to Copilot):</h1>
    <div>
        This project was created by Matsepus as a way to keep track of albums he has listened to, and to share his thoughts on them. 
        The goal is to create a simple and easy-to-use web application that allows users to add albums, rate them, and leave comments.
        The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is hosted on GitHub Pages.
    </div>
    <div>That was all created by AI based on what information my scripts contain. Weird stuff.</div>
    <h1>What This Project Is About (According to me):</h1>
    <div>I set a goal for myself in mid-november; to listen to an album I have never listened to before every single day of 2026. I generally get tired of music, and I need some new stuff to listen to.
        <br>
        I also have a shit-ton of saved albums in my Spotify that I have still not listened to (some of them have been saved since 2021).
        I need to clean up a bit, as Spotify uses about 95% of the storage space on my phone.
        <br></br>
        When I set this goal, I did not know of any ways to register Albums that you had listened to. With my (limited) knowledge of the holy trinity of HTML, CSS and JS
        I set out to make my own website for this purpose. So far this has taken me about:
        <br>
        <div id="workTime">&emsp;&emsp;30hrs</div>
        of work, JS being maybe 40%, CSS 50% and HTML the remaining 10%. Yes, the site should look better when I have spent that much time on css, but that is probably my worst language.
        <br>
        <br>
        To make sure I have never listened to the album before (some are that forgettable) I use Stats.fm which logs everything you listen to on your Spotify account.
        <br>
        For most of the albums I will use Spotify, but I also have a vinyl player setup, in addition to my fathers sizeable vinyl collection.
        <br>
        <br>
        I would love for people to give suggestions, so please use the suggestion site in the side menu (I truly want all the suggestions I can get).
        <br>
        I am working on making this website more suitable for other users, not just as my personal website (will probably be fixed soon, and I will probably forget to remove this part).
        <br>
